3.	Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
A task is consider "Done" only when:
  1. The documentation/code is fully implemented and tested.
  2. It is commited and pushed to GitHub.
  3. It has been reviewed and approved by at least one team member.

4.	Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
5.	Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates) (done)

Procedure for adoptiing policies:
    Step 1: A team member calls a meeting to propose a policy
    Step 2: The team members explain the policy proposal
    Step 3: The whole team votes for policy
    Step 4: If majority votes for it, then the policy is adopted. If not, then it is not adopted.

General Policies:
    1. Code style
        All methods created should have proper documentation preceeding it. This documentation can be as simple as a
        one-line comment. Complex methods should have documentation that explains the input and output of method.
        We will use camelCase to name variables and methods.
    2. Code check-in steps:
        The team will perform a check-in at the beginning of every sprint meeting. Depending on how far people are in their
        code, it could impact the content of the daily sprint. Impromptu code check-ins can occur if the team decides it by majority vote.
    3. Regarding documentation updates
        Any team members concerned about documentation should report to the team leader for discussion. A meeting may need to be call
        to update any documentation in order to ensure there is no confusion among team members.

6.	if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here (done)
7.	Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
If a team member is not fulfilling their responsibilities, the following steps will be taken:
	1.	Step 1: Private Discussion – A teammate will talk to the member to understand any difficulties.
	2.	Step 2: Group Discussion – The team will meet to address concerns and offer solutions.
	3.	Step 3: Written Warning – If the issue continues, a written agreement will be made with clear expectations.
	4.	Step 4: Instructor Involvement – If no improvement occurs, the issue will be escalated to the instructor.

8.	must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
9.	Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
